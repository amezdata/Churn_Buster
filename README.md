# **Overview:**  

This data analysis project for an e-commerce company, is presented as a part of my portfolio. It encapsulates a holistic approach towards understanding customer behavior, identifying churn predictors, and drawing strategic insights for the company's growth and sustainability. The project is grounded in both economic and commercial perspectives, providing actionable recommendations based on data-driven insights.

# **Objective:**

The primary goal of this project is to provide the e-commerce company with deep insights into customer behavior, predictive tools for identifying potential churn, and strategic recommendations to improve customer retention and overall profitability. It pretends to be more than just a showcase of technical skills; it represents a practical application of data analytics in shaping strategic business decisions and guiding policies for companies.

# **Limitations:**  

This project involves analysis and modeling of e-commerce data, undertaken without detailed contextual understanding of the data collection process or units of measurement for certain variables. While all outliers have been assumed as extreme values rather than errors, this assumption may not accurately reflect the true nature of the data. A preprocessing pipeline has been implemented to robustly handle different data types and address imbalances in the machine learning models. However, readers should be aware that these approaches, while comprehensive, may not fully account for underlying complexities or specific characteristics of the dataset. Consequently, the findings and models presented should be interpreted considering these limitations.
